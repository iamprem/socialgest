Pass the input in [tr_d,tr_l] matrix, so the last column is the target variable.

Feature file name: featureMEEC.m 
Classifier: MATLAB's Classification tool with SVM Cubic 

Used Mean, Energy, Frequency-Entropy, Correlation between axes as features. 

Feature length is 12. 

Trained using Matlab's classification tool. 
And SVM with cubic polynomial kernel gave the best of 90.4% Validated with the validation set, which gave accuracy of 90.83%
