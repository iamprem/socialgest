Same features as submission 5, only difference is training with 
10 fold cross validation with matlab's svm

Feature file name: featureMEEC.m 
Classifier: MATLAB's Classification tool with SVM Cubic with Validation of 10 fold 

Used Mean, Energy, Frequency-Entropy, Correlation between axes as features. 
Feature length is 12.

Trained using Matlab's classification tool. And SVM with cubic polynomial kernel gave the best of 89.8% Validated with the validation set, which gave accuracy of 92.33%
